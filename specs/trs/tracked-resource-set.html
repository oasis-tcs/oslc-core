        The Tracked Resource Set protocol allows a server to expose a set of resources in a way that allows clients to
        discover the exact set of resources in the set, to track additions to and removals from the set, and to track
        state changes to the resources in the set. The protocol does not assume that clients will dereference the
        resources, but they could do so. The protocol is suitable for dealing with large sets containing a large number
        of resources, as well as highly active resource sets that undergo continual change. The protocol is HTTP-based
        and follows RESTful principles.

      <p class="conformance">
        This specification is based on [[!OSLCCore3]]. OSLC Tracked Resource Set Servers servers MUST be compliant with
        the Core specification, MUST follow all the mandatory requirements in the normative sections of each part of
        this specification, and SHOULD follow all the guidelines and recommendations in both these specifications.

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        An OSLC Tracked Resource Set (TRS) provides a mechanism for making a set of resources discoverable and for
        reporting ongoing changes affecting the set. This allows tools to expose a live feed of linked lifecycle data in
        a way that permits other tools to build, aggregate, and maintain live, searchable information based on that
        linked data.
      </p>
      <p>
        TRS Clients can use Tracked Resource Sets to monitor or replicate some of the server’s resources, keeping up to
        date with changes. A single TRS Client could get information from many different TRS Servers and Tracked
        Resource Sets in order to aggregate information into a repository for more efficient federated access to the
        resource data, or for access using a different query language or protocol. The TRS protocol does not guarantee
        that a client can calculate a complete change history (audit log) for the tracked resources.

      <h2>Basic Concepts</h2>
      <p>
        A TRS Server maintains one or more Tracked Resource Sets. The TRS Server decides which particular resources are
        in a particular Tracked Resource Set at any moment; both the Tracked Resource Sets and the linked data contents
        of each Tracked Resource can vary over time. An HTTP GET request sent to the Tracked Resource Set URI returns a
        representation of the state of the Tracked Resource Set characterized in terms of a Base and a Change Log. The
        Base is a Linked Data Platform (LDP) Container providing a point-in-time enumeration of the Tracked Resource
        members of the Tracked Resource Set; The Change Log provides a (possibly empty) time-ordered series of
        adjustments describing changes to the Tracked Resources. When the Base is empty, the Change Log describes a
        history of how the Tracked Resource Set has grown and evolved since its inception. A TRS Server can periodically
        update the Base of a TRS and truncate the Change Log to avoid excessively large Change Logs. Clients can read
        the Base and poll the Change Log to derive and maintain an up to date picture of the state of all the Tracked
        Resources in a Tracked Resource Set.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Change Log portion can contain earlier Change Event entries that would be accounted for by the Base portion.
        A “cutoff” property of the Base identifies the point in the Change Log at which processing of Change Events can
        be cut off because older changes are already covered by the Base portion. TRS Clients use the Base to establish
        the resources to track, and the Change Log to address changes to those resources. TRS Clients are responsible
        for knowing what change events they have already processed in the Change Log, and should only process new change
        events.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id="discovery">
      <h2>Discovery</h2>
      <p class="note" title="Discovery is a convenience">
        Discoverability is a convenience; an administrator can configure a Client with a particular Tracked Resource Set
        knowing just the URIs of the Server's Tracked Resource Set and designated Access Context List resource. An
        administrator can retrieve the Access Context List resource to discover the titles and URIs of the Access
        Contexts being used with that Server. Documentation for an TRS Server can describe its Tracked Resource Sets,
        including the URI of each of the Server's Tracked Resource Set resources and designated Access Context List
        resources.
      </p>
      <p class="conformance">
        A Server MAY provide multiple Tracked Resource Sets, and MAY make its Tracked Resource Sets discoverable.
      </p>
      <p>
        The RDF <code>trs:trackedResourceSet</code> property can be used to declare the whereabouts of a Tracked
        Resource Set resource. The Tracked Resource Set resource is the object.
      </p>
      <p>
        This allows the existence and location of a Tracked Resource Set resource to be declared with an RDF statement
        like the following (rendered here in Turtle):
      </p>
      <pre class="example">
@prefix trs: &lt;http://open-services.net/ns/core/trs#&gt; .
&lt;&gt; trs:trackedResourceSet &lt;https://a.example.com/trs1&gt; .
    </pre
      >
      <p>Where such RDF statements might be found is outside the scope of this specification.</p>

        A Server MUST eventually report a resource modification event if a GET on that resource would return a

        A Server MAY report a modification event even in cases where there would be no significant difference in
        response.
      </p>
      <p class="conformance">
        When a resource is modified two or more times in rapid succession, a Server MAY elide such modifications by

      <p>
        Because of the highly dynamic nature of the Resource Set and the difficulty of enumerating an exact set of
        resources at a precise point in time,
        <span class="conformance"
          >a Server MAY produce a Base that is only an approximation of the Tracked Resource Set membership</span

      </p>
      <p class="conformance">
        Similarly, a TRS Server MAY report unnecessary Change Events such as a creation event for a Resource that is
        already a member of the Resource Set, or a deletion event for a Resource that is not a member of the Resource
        Set.
      </p>

        Often, the number of Change Events in the Change Log will grow to the point where it is not reasonable to

      <p class="conformance">
        Just as the most recent Change Events MUST be included in the HTTP response for the Change Log in the Tracked
        Resource Set resource itself, TRS Servers MUST include the Change Events for each Change Log segment in the HTTP
        response for the Change Log segment.
      </p>
      <p class="note">
        This allows a Client to discover the most recent Change Events, and retrieve successively older Change Log
        resources until it encounters a Change Event that has already been processed (on a previous check). The protocol
        does not attach significance to where a Server breaks the Change Log into separate parts, i.e., the number of
        entries in a trs:ChangeLog is entirely up to the Server.

        Resources can be segmented into separate resources. There can be any number of such base member Resource
        segments, each one containing a subset of all base member Resource segments

          >A chain of Change Logs MAY continue all the way back to the inception of the Tracked Resource Set and contain
          Change Events for every change made since then.</span
        >
        However, to avoid maintaining this ever growing list of Change Logs indefinitely,
        <span class="conformance">a Server MAY truncate the Change Log at a suitable point in the chain</span>. This can
        be accomplished by deleting the oldest segments of the Change Log and/or by removing
        <code>trs:previous</code> links that reference them, and/or by removing obsolete Change Events from the end of
        the Change Log.
      </p>
      <p class="note">
        TRS Servers can therefore return HTTP status code 404 (Not found) when navigating the "previous" reference from
        a final or stale Change Log segment; clients should interpret this as indicating that they have reached the end
        of the change log.
      </p>
      <p>
        To ensure that a new Client can always get started,
        <span class="conformance">the Change Log MUST contain the base cutoff event of the corresponding Base</span>,
        and all Change Events more recent than it. Thus the Server is only allowed to truncate Change Events older than
        the base cutoff event.
        <span class="conformance"
          >When the Base has no base cutoff event (i.e., the Base enumerates the Resource Set at the start of time), the
          Change Log MUST contain all Change Events back to the start of time; i.e., no truncation is allowed</span
        >.
      </p>
      <p class="note">
        While servers preserve the cutoff event in the truncated change log, the same is not true of any earlier events
        that a client might have already processed. For this reason, a client should not assume that it will find a
        change event that it has previously processed: that change event might have been truncated.
      </p>
      <p>
        To allow truncation of long Change Logs,
        <span class="conformance"
          >a TRS Server MAY calculate a new base set at any time, with a new cutoff event in the Change Log</span
        >. When doing this,
        <span class="conformance"
          >TRS Servers SHOULD take care to handle clients that are currently processing the older Base and Change

      </p>
      <ul>
        <li class="conformance">
          When calculating a new Base, the TRS Server SHOULD retain Change Events before the new cutoff event that a
          reasonable client might still be processing. This specification does not impose specific constraints over the
          length of time for which a TRS base must remain readable, the size of pages in the base or change log, nor
          what the degree of overlap should be between a base and a corresponding change log. These are quality of
          implementation issues, and should be described in the server documentation.

      <h2>TRS Patch</h2>
      <p>
        This section describes an extension to Change Events allowing them to carry detailed information about
        modifications to resources with an RDF representation.
      </p>
      <section id="patch-motivation">
        <h3>Use cases for Patch Events - TBD - needs better wording and organization</h3>
        <p>
          For a Resource that changes frequently, a typical Client might otherwise need to retrieve the same Resource
          over and over again. When the representation of the Resource is large and the differences between adjacent
          representations can be described compactly, including additional information in the trs:Modification Change
          Event can allow the Client to determine the Resource’s current representation and thereby avoid having to
          retrieve the Resource.
        </p>
        <p>
          Similiarly, in versioned worlds each change to a versioned resource could result in the creation of a new
          Resource representing an immutable version of the resource. The typical Client retrieves each such Resource as
          it is created. The state of the new Resource is often quite similar to the state of a Resource corresponding
          to a previous version. When the state of one Resource is similar to that of another Resource and the
          differences between the two can be described compactly, including additional information in the trs:Creation
          Change Event can allow the Client to determine the new Resource’s resultant state from the potentially-known
          state of a previously-retrieved Resource and thereby avoid having to retrieve the new Resource.

          <em>Editor - move this to the shape table</em>
          The <code>trspatch:createdFrom</code> property, when present, identifies the antecedent resource. If omitted,
          the antecedent resource is the resource referenced in the <code>trs:changed</code> property. The antecedent
          resource is the one that supplies the “before” state.

      <section id="rdfPatch">
        <p>
          <em>Editor - move this to the shape table</em>
          The <code>trspatch:rdfPatch</code> property, when present, describes a patch applied to the antecedent
          resource’s representation. The result of applying the patch describes the representation of the resource
          referenced in the <code>trs:changed</code> property. The <code>trspatch:rdfPatch</code> property is used with
          <code>trs:Modification</code> and <code>trs:Creation</code> Change Events; it is not meaningful for
          <code>trs:Deletion</code> Change Events. The value of the <code>trspatch:rdfPatch</code> property is an LD
          Patch. The <code>trspatch:rdfPatch</code> property is meaningful only for resources with RDF representations.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="beforeEtag">
        <p>
          <em>Editor - move this to the shape table</em>
          The <code>trspatch:beforeETag</code> property, when present, gives the initial HTTP entity tag of the
          antecedent resource. This is the entity-tag value that would be returned in the HTTP ETag response header if
          the antecedent resource is retrieved immediately before the change.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="afterEtag">
        <p>
          <em>Editor - move this to the shape table</em>
          The <code>trspatch:afterETag</code> property, when present, gives the final HTTP entity tag of the resource
          referenced in the trs:changed property. For a <code>trs:Modification</code> (<code>trs:Creation</code>) Change
          Event, this is the entity tag of the resource immediately after it was modified (created, respectively). This
          is the entity-tag value that would be returned in the HTTP ETag response header if the resource is retrieved
          immediately after the change.
        </p>
      </section>
      <p>
        Note that these properties are can be used with any resource having both an RDF representation and an entity
        tag. This includes all Linked Data Platform RDF Source (LDP-RS) resources, which have both.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note also that the <code>trspatch:beforeETag</code> and <code>trspatch:afterETag</code> properties are
        meaningful for any kind of resource, not just ones with RDF representations.
